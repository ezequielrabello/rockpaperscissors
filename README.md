# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game

A clean and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH).

## 🎮 Features

- Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors

  - First your choice is displayed
  - Then the computer’s choice appears after a delay
  - Finally, the result is revealed
